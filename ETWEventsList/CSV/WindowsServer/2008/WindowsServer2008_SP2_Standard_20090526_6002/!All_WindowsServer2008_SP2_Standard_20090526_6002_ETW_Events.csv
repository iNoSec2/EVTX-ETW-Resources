Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,win:Error,1126,0,System,,win:Start,,Windows was unable to determine whether new Group Policy settings defined by a network administrator should be enforced for this user or computer because this computer's clock is not synchronized with the clock of one of the domain controllers for the domain. Because of this issue; this computer system may not be in compliance with the network administrator’s requirements; and users of this system may not be able to use some functionality on the network. Windows will periodically attempt to retry this operation; and it is possible that either this system or the domain controller will correct the time settings without intervention by an administrator; so the problem will be corrected. If this issue persists for more than an hour; checking the local system's clock settings to ensure they are accurate and are synchronized with the clocks on the network's domain controllers is one way to resolve this problem. A network administrator may be required to resolve the issue if correcting the local time settings does not address the problem.

Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos,,1073741828,0,,,,,The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server {Server}. The target name used was {Targetname}. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Please ensure that the target SPN is registered on; and only registered on; the account used by the server. This error can also happen when the target service is using a different password for the target service account than what the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) has for the target service account. Please ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both updated to use the current password. If the server name is not fully qualified; and the target domain ({TargetRealm}) is different from the client domain ({ClientRealm}); check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains; or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.
Microsoft-Windows-Security-Kerberos,,1073741829,0,,,,,The kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_TKT_NYV error from the server {Server}.
