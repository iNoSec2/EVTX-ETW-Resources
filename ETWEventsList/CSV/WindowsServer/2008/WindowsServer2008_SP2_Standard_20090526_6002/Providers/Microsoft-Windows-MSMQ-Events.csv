Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,2147485810,0,,,,,Message Queuing Down-level Client Support failed to create the MSMQ Configuration (msmq) object with a given GUID for computer {param1}. Creating MSMQ Configuration objects with given GUIDs may be required for Message Queuing clients during the setup of Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 9x computers and when a Windows 2000 computer joins a Windows Server 2003 (or later) domain. By default; an Active Directory Domain Services forest does not support adding an object with a supplied GUID. You can solve this problem by upgrading Message Queuing on the client computer to a version that does not require creating an object with a given GUID. There are also alternative solutions.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,1073743987,0,,,,,The Message Queuing service stopped.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227636,0,,,,,The Message Queuing service will not join the {param1} domain.

Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227638,0,,,,,The Message Queuing service cannot join the '{param1}' Windows NT 4.0 domain. The Active Directory Domain Services Integration subcomponent was therefore removed.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,1073743991,0,,,,,Message Queuing is operating in Hardened mode.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227640,0,,,,,The Message Queuing service resource cannot bind to the cluster IP address. This prevents the Message Queuing resource from coming online on this node. One possible reason is that the Message Queuing service running on the physical node was started before the computer became a member of the server cluster. As a result; the Message Queuing service running on the physical node listens on all IP addresses of the computer and prevents the Message Queuing resource from listening on the cluster IP address. To solve this problem; restart the Message Queuing service on the physical node. Error {param1}: {param2}
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227641,0,,,,,The local computer is a Message Queuing routing server that formerly belonged to the '{param1}' domain and is now operating in workgroup mode. Other Message Queuing clients still regard this computer as a routing server and will try to route messages through this computer. To solve this problem; you need to manually delete the Message Queuing objects for this computer in Active Directory Domain Services. Please delete the following two objects: 1) The msmq object under the computer object of this computer in the Computers container in the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in: 'CN=msmq;CN={param2};CN=computers;DC={param1};DC=...' 2) The MSMQ Settings object under the server object for this computer in the Active Directory Sites and Services snap-in: 'CN=MSMQ Settings;CN={param2};CN=Servers;CN=<SiteName>;CN=Sites;CN=Configuration;DC=...' You also need to uninstall Routing Support and Down-level Client Support by using Server Role Manager.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227642,0,,,,,Message Queuing failed to bind to port 1801. The port may already be bound to another process. Make sure that the port is free and try to start Message Queuing again. If this problem arises during setup; you must free the port and run setup again.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,2147485819,0,,,,,Message Queuing cannot bind to UDP port 3527. Message Queuing's internal ping mechanism uses this port to establish network connections. Another process may be using this port. Message Queuing can continue to operate without using this port; but connection times will not be optimal. To optimize the establishment of connections; free this port and restart Message Queuing.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,1073743996,0,,,,,The MsmqServices object is configured with weakened security to support MSMQ 1.0 clients. With weakened security; the Message Queuing Down-level Client Support service will use its own rights (under the LocalSystem account on a domain controller) to view object properties; but it will not bypass the security restrictions on creating Message Queuing objects and setting their properties.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,1073743997,0,,,,,The MsmqServices object is configured with default security. MSMQ 1.0 clients will not be able to query Active Directory Domain Services in this configuration.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227646,0,,,,,Message Queuing Down-level Client Support cannot operate in mixed mode. Mixed mode is a transient mode in which Message Queuing deployment is in the middle of migration from MQIS (for MSMQ 1.0) to Active Directory Domain Services. In this mode; some sites are still Windows NT 4.0 sites and are mastered by the PEC and PSCs. Mixed mode might require creating/deleting/updating objects that belong to Windows NT 4.0 sites. These operations are not supported by Message Queuing Down-level Client Support. After completing the migration of all Windows NT 4.0 sites to Active Directory Domain Services (migration of the PEC and all PSCs in Windows NT 4.0 sites); Message Queuing will no longer be in mixed mode.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,2147485823,0,,,,,Message Queuing will use an encryption key with an effective length of 40 bits when sending messages encrypted with the RC2 encryption algorithm. To restore strong encryption; remove the registry value HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\Security\SendEnhRC2With40.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,1073744000,0,,,,,Message Queuing found multiple IP addresses for the local computer. Message Queuing will use the default IP address determined by the PGM driver for multicast messages. To use a different IP address; set the \HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\{param1} registry value to one of the following valid IP addresses: {param2}.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,3221227649,0,,,,,The Message Queuing service rejects incoming messages when it is unable to check whether the sender is allowed access to the queue for sending messages. In this case; the queue affected is {param1}; but note that an event might not be issued every time this problem occurs. To perform this access check; Message Queuing needs access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute of the sender's user object. Only users with domain administration permissions can add members to the Windows Authorization Access Group; which is allowed access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute; in one of two ways: 1) For best security practice; add only the computer accounts that need access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute to the Windows Authorization Access Group. The domain administrator will repeat this operation for other Message Queuing computers that require the permission; manually adding the relevant accounts to the Windows Authorization Access Group. 2) As a less secure practice; add the Authenticated Users group to the Windows Authorization Access group. This grants every authenticated user; including the Message Queuing service on any computer; access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute for all users; and requires no further manual administration.
Microsoft-Windows-MSMQ-Events,,2147485829,0,,,,,Message Queuing cannot establish new connections to this computer because connection limit was reached.  There are too many computers attempting to send messages to or receive from this computer. This event is logged at most once per {param1} seconds.
