Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Informational,5,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: This host is an active member of the NLB cluster. The host priority (unique host identifier) is {param5}. It will start load balancing traffic as soon as it converges with the rest of the cluster hosts.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Informational,6,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: This host is no longer an active member of the NLB cluster.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,9,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The NLB driver failed to bind to the adapter because the medium type is unsupported. Please confirm that you are trying to bind NLB to an Ethernet network adapter.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,10,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The NLB driver could not allocate enough memory resources to perform driver operations. Close all programs on this cluster host that might be consuming memory and rebind NLB to the adapters. If this problem persists; you might need to add additional memory (RAM) to this host.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,14,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The NLB driver failed to initialize because the cluster network address {param3} is invalid. Please check that the network address property of the NLB cluster is specified in a valid MAC address format.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,15,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The dedicated IP (DIP) address {param3} is invalid. The cluster will converge and operate normally without this DIP. However; if this DIP is required for remote cluster management; make sure that the DIP is specified in a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address format.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,16,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The NLB driver failed to initialize because the cluster IP address {param3} is invalid. Please check that the network IP address is specified in a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address format.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,17,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB detected a duplicate host priority {param5} that is shared between cluster hosts. Each host in the NLB cluster must have a unique host priority. Please check the NLB configuration of all hosts and make sure that each has a unique host priority (a number between 1 and 32).
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,18,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB detected duplicate cluster subnets. This may be due to network partitioning; which prevents NLB heartbeats of one or more hosts from reaching the other cluster hosts. Although NLB operations have resumed properly; please investigate the cause of the network partitioning.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,19,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The maximum number of actively serviced connections that could be tracked by NLB is reached. Although NLB will still accept new connections; it will not track the connection state until other connections are closed. This might result in breaking the affinity maintained by the driver during the connection. To resolve this issue; add more hosts to the cluster and/or increase the {param3} value under the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLBS\Parameters\Interface\{GUID} key in the registry.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,20,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to converge due to port rules with a duplicate single host priority {param5} in the cluster. Each single host port rule in the NLB cluster must have a unique priority. Please check the NLB configuration of all port rules and make sure that each has a unique host priority (a number between 1 and 32).
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,21,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to converge due to inconsistencies in the port rules between this host and cluster host {param5}.

Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,25,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: A port rule operation on port {param3} was issued but there is no port rule that contains this port. Please confirm that the intended port number is correct; or configure a port rule for this port number.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,26,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: A port rule operation was issued while the host was in the stopped state. Such operations can only be performed on a running cluster host. Please ensure that the cluster host is an active member before issuing port rule operations.

Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Informational,29,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: Host {param5} converged with host(s){param3}. It is now an active member of the NLB cluster and will start load balancing traffic as the default host. The default host is the host with the lowest host priority. It handles all traffic that isn't covered by any of the defined port rules.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,30,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The dedicated network mask {param3} is invalid. The cluster will converge and operate normally without this dedicated IP (DIP) address. However; if this DIP is required for remote cluster management; make sure that the dedicated network mask for the DIP is specified in a valid format.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,31,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: The NLB driver failed to initialize because the cluster network mask {param3} is invalid. Please check that the network mask is specified in a valid format.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,32,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB detected an unequal number of dedicated IP (DIP) addresses and network masks. For all DIP's listed for use; an equal number of network masks must be specified. The NLB cluster will continue to operate; but the DIP that has no corresponding network mask will be ignored. To use this DIP; make sure that the number of addresses and network masks are the same.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,34,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to query parameters from the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLBS\Parameters\Interface\{param3}. This might be due to an improper configuration. Please use Network Load Balancing Manager to configure NLB. Once the configuration is fixed; you should run 'nlb reload' followed by 'nlb start' from a command prompt.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,35,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to verify its parameters. This might be due to an improper configuration.

Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Informational,48,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: This host has suspended cluster operations. Until it is resumed; this host will not be an active member of the cluster.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,50,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to add a multicast MAC address to the network adapter it is bound to. This happened because the maximum number of multicast MAC addresses that can be assigned to this network adapter has been exhausted. Use a network adapter that supports more multicast MAC addresses or operate NLB in unicast mode.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Informational,52,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: Registry parameters successfully reloaded without resetting the driver.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,53,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB will not attach to adapter '{param3}' because it does not support dynamic changing of its MAC address. Replace the network adapter with one which supports that capability.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,55,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: An inconsistent teaming configuration was detected for bi-directional affinity (BDA) on host {param5}. BDA configuration must be identical on all cluster hosts. The team in which this cluster participates will be marked inactive and this cluster will remain in the converging state until consistent teaming configuration is detected.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,56,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: Invalid bi-directional affinity (BDA) team ID detected. Team IDs must be a GUID of the form {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}. To add this cluster to a team; correct the team ID and run 'nlb reload' followed by 'nlb start' from the command prompt.
Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Error,57,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: Invalid bi-directional affinity (BDA) teaming port rules detected.

Microsoft-Windows-NLB,win:Warning,74,0,System,,,,NLB cluster [{param2}]: NLB failed to update the NLB host state in the registry. This will affect the ability of NLB to persist the current state after the system restarts; if NLB has been configured to do so. To predict the state of NLB at the next restart; please delete the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WLBS\Parameters\Interface\{GUID}\{param3} registry value; which will cause the state at the next system restart to revert to the user-specified preferred initial host state.
