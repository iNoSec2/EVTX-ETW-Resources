Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service,Warning,11,0,System,,,,Time Provider NtpClient: This machine is configured to use the domain hierarchy to determine its time source; but it is not a member of a domain. NtpClient will attempt to use an alternate configured external time source if available. If an external time source is not configured or used for this computer; you may choose to disable the NtpClient.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service,Warning,12,0,System,,,,Time Provider NtpClient: This machine is configured to use the domain hierarchy to determine its time source; but it is the AD PDC emulator for the domain at the root of the forest; so there is no machine above it in the domain hierarchy to use as a time source. It is recommended that you either configure a reliable time service in the root domain; or manually configure the AD PDC to synchronize with an external time source. Otherwise; this machine will function as the authoritative time source in the domain hierarchy. If an external time source is not configured or used for this computer; you may choose to disable the NtpClient.

This occurs when the time source and local system time are far enough apart that clock rate adjustments cannot be made to reach the time specified by the time source.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service,Error,34,0,System,,,,The time service has detected that the system time needs to be  changed by {SystemTimeChangeSeconds} seconds. The time service will not change the system time by more than {MaxSystemTimeChangeSeconds} seconds. Verify that your time and time zone are correct; and that the time source {TimeSource} is working properly.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service,Information,35,0,System,,,,The time service is now synchronizing the system time with the time source {TimeSource}.
Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service,Warning,36,0,System,,,,The time service has not synchronized the system time for {UnsynchronizedTimeSeconds} seconds because none of the time service providers provided a usable time stamp. The time service will not update the local system time until it is able to synchronize with a time source. If the local system is configured to act as a time server for clients; it will stop advertising as a time source to clients. The time service will continue to retry and sync time with its time sources. Check system event log for other W32time events for more details. Run 'w32tm /resync' to force an instant time synchronization.
