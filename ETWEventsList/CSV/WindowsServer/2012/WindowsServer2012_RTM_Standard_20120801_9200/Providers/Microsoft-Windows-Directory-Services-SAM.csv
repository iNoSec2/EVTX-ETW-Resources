Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Warning,16653,0,System,,,,A pool size for account-identifiers (RIDs) that was configured by an Administrator is greater than the supported maximum. The maximum value of {Maximum} will be used when the domain controller is the RID master. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225963 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Information,16654,0,System,,,,A pool of account-identifiers (RIDs) has been invalidated. This may occur in the following expected cases:1. A domain controller is restored from backup. 2. A domain controller running on a virtual machine is restored from snapshot. 3. An administrator has manually invalidated the pool. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226247 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Information,16655,0,System,,,,The global maximum for account-identifiers (RIDs) has been increased to {NewValue}.  See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=233329 for more information including important operating system interoperability requirements.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Warning,16656,0,System,,,,Action required! An account-identifier (RID) pool was allocated to this domain controller. The pool value indicates this domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers. A protection mechanism will be activated when the domain reaches the following threshold of total available account-identifiers remaining: {CeilingTriggerRid}.  The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users; computers and groups; or promote new DCs into the domain. The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier allocation on the RID master domain controller. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228610 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Error,16657,0,System,,,,Action required! This domain has consumed a considerable portion of the total available account-identifiers (RIDs). A protection mechanism has been activated because the total available account-identifiers remaining is approximately: {CeilingTriggerRid}. The protection mechanism prevents the allocation of account-identifier (RID) pools needed to allow existing DCs to create additional users; computers and groups; or promote new DCs into the domain.  The mechanism will remain active until the Administrator manually re-enables account-identifier (RID) allocation on the RID master domain controller. It is extremely important that certain diagnostics be performed prior to re-enabling account creation to ensure this domain is not consuming account-identifiers at an abnormally high rate. Any issues identified should be resolved prior to re-enabling account creation. Failure to diagnose and fix any underlying issue causing an abnormally high rate of account-identifier consumption can lead to account-identifier (RID) pool exhaustion in the domain after which account creation will be permanently disabled in this domain. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228610 for more information.
Microsoft-Windows-Directory-Services-SAM,Warning,16658,0,System,,,,This event is a periodic update on the remaining total quantity of available account-identifiers (RIDs). The number of remaining account-identifiers is approximately: {RemainingRids}. Account-identifiers are used as accounts are created; when they are exhausted no new accounts may be created in the domain. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228745 for more information.
