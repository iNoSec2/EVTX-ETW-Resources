Group Policy settings will not be resolved until this event is resolved. View the event details for more information on the file name and path that caused the failure.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1097,0,System,,Start,,The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not determine the computer account to enforce Group Policy settings. This may be transient. Group Policy settings; including computer configuration; will not be enforced for this computer.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1101,0,System,,Start,,The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not locate the directory object {DSObjectName}. Group Policy settings will not be enforced until this event is resolved. View the event details for more information on this error.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Warning,1104,0,System,,Start,,Windows was unable to read the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) filter information associated with the Group Policy object {GPOCNName}.This may be caused by a deleted WMI Filter defined in the domain that is still in use by Group Policy objects. Group Policy settings for this Group Policy object will not be enforced. Other Group Policy objects may still apply. Windows will attempt to retrieve this information at the next policy cycle. This specific problem may be resolved by identifying all GPOs that reference the WMI filter and removing the references. Contact an administrator if this event recurs for several hours.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Warning,1109,0,System,,Start,,The user account is in a different forest than the computer account. The processing of Group Policy from another forest is not allowed. Group Policy will be processed using Loopback Replace mode. The scope of the user policy settings will be determined by the location of the computer object in Active Directory. The settings will be acquired from the User Configuration of these policies.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1110,0,System,,Start,,The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not determine if the user and computer accounts are in the same forest. Ensure the user domain name matches the name of a trusted domain that resides in the same forest as the computer account.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Warning,1112,0,System,,Start,,The Group Policy Client Side Extension {ExtensionName} was unable to apply one or more settings because the changes must be processed before system startup or user logon. The system will wait for Group Policy processing to finish completely before the next startup or logon for this user; and this may result in slow startup and boot performance.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1125,0,System,,Start,,The processing of Group Policy failed because of an internal system error. Please see the Group Policy operational log for the specific error message. An attempt will be made to process Group Policy again at the next refresh cycle.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1126,0,System,,Start,,Windows was unable to determine whether new Group Policy settings defined by a network administrator should be enforced for this user or computer because this computer's clock is not synchronized with the clock of one of the domain controllers for the domain. Because of this issue; this computer system may not be in compliance with the network administrator’s requirements; and users of this system may not be able to use some functionality on the network. Windows will periodically attempt to retry this operation; and it is possible that either this system or the domain controller will correct the time settings without intervention by an administrator; so the problem will be corrected. If this issue persists for more than an hour; checking the local system's clock settings to ensure they are accurate and are synchronized with the clocks on the network's domain controllers is one way to resolve this problem. A network administrator may be required to resolve the issue if correcting the local time settings does not address the problem.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1127,0,System,,Start,,The processing of Group Policy failed due to an internal error. Please look into the Group Policy operational log for the specific error message. An attempt will be made to process Group Policy again at the next refresh cycle.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Warning,1128,0,System,,,,The Group Policy Client Side Extension {ExtensionName} may have caused the Group Policy Service to terminate unexpectedly. To prevent further failures in the Group Policy Service; this extension has been temporarily disabled until after the next system restart. Group Policy settings managed by this extension may no longer be enforced until the system is restarted. The vendor of this extension should be contacted if this issue recurs.
Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy,Error,1129,0,System,,,,The processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of network connectivity to a domain controller. This may be a transient condition. A success message would be generated once the machine gets connected to the domain controller and Group Policy has successfully processed. If you do not see a success message for several hours; then contact your administrator.
