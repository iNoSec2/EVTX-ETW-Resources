Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8003,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS Server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The cause of this DNS registration failure was because the DNS update request timed out after being sent to the specified DNS Server. This is probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being updated is not running.You can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still  persist; contact your network systems administrator to verify network conditions.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8004,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure. This may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific Domain Suffix that was indicated above.) You can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist; contact your network systems administrator to verify network conditions.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8005,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason it could not register was because either: (a) the DNS server does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol; or (b) the primary zone authoritative for the registering names does not currently accept dynamic updates.To add or register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS name for this adapter; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8006,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason it could not register was because the DNS server refused the dynamic update request. This could happen for the following reasons: (a) current DNS update policies do not allow this computer to update the DNS domain name configured for this adapter; or (b) the authoritative DNS server for this DNS domain name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.To register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS domain name for this adapter; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8007,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The system could not register the DNS update request because of a security related problem. This could happen for the following reasons: (a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could not be updated because your computer does not have the right permissions; or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server to update.You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8008,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason the DNS update request could not be completed was because of a system problem. You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Information,8009,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapterwith settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address :             {Ipaddress}The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because the update request that was sent to the specified DNS server timed out. This is probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being registered is not running.You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Information,8010,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to register pointer (PTR) resource records (RRs) for network adapterwith settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address :             {Ipaddress}The cause was DNS server failure. This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to update. In most cases; this is a minor problem because it does not affect normal (forward) name resolution.If reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer; you can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist; contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error code information.

Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8021,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to update and remove registration for the network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason for this failure is because the DNS server it sent the update request to timed out. The most likely cause of this failure is that the DNS server authoritative for the zone where the registration was originally made is either not running or unreachable through the network at this time.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8022,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to update and remove registration for the network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason for this failure is because the DNS server it sent the update to failed the update request. A possible cause of this failure is that the DNS server required to process this update request has a lock in place on the zone; probably because a zone transfer is in progress.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8023,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to update and remove registration for the network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason for this failure is because the DNS server sent the update either (a) does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol; or (b) the authoritative zone for the specified DNS domain name does not currently accept DNS dynamic updates.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8024,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to update and remove registration for the network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason the system could not perform the update request was the DNS server contacted refused update request. The cause of this is (a) this computer is not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name; or (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the zone that requires updating does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.
Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Client,Warning,8025,0,System,DnsRegistration,,,The system failed to update and remove registration for the network adapter with settings:           Adapter Name : {AdapterName}           Host Name : {HostName}           Adapter-specific Domain Suffix : {AdapterSuffixName}           DNS server list :             {DnsServerList}           Sent update to server : {Sent UpdateServer}           IP Address(es) :             {Ipaddress}The reason the system could not perform the update request was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be (a) your computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain name set for this adapter; or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server during the processing of the update request.See event details for specific error code information.
