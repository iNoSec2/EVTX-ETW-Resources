Microsoft-Windows-SharedAccess_NAT,,30013,0,,,,,The DHCP allocator has disabled itself on IP address {param1}; since the IP address is outside the {param2}/{param3} scope from which addresses are being allocated to DHCP clients. To enable the DHCP allocator on this IP address; change the scope to include the IP address; or change the IP address to fall within the scope.
