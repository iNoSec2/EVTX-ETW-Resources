The configured data '{configuredValue}' could not be parsed as type '{desiredType}'. Section: {configurationSection} Parameter: {configurationParameter} Data: {configuredValue} Type: {desiredType} The Federation Service or Federation Service Proxy will not be able to start until this configuration parameter is corrected. User Action Correct the specified web.config parameter to conform to the given type.,{configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {configuredValue} | {desiredType} | {configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {configuredValue} | {desiredType}
601,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,During processing of web.config section '{configurationSection}'; the parameter '{configurationParameter}' was found to have invalid data. The private key for the certificate that was identified by the thumbprint '{certificateThumbprint}' could not be accessed. Section: {configurationSection} Parameter: {configurationParameter} Thumbprint: {certificateThumbprint} The Federation Service or Federation Service Proxy will not be able to start until this configuration parameter is corrected. This condition can occur when the certificate that is identified by the thumbprint is found in the Local Computer Personal store but there is a problem accessing the certificate's private key. Common causes for this condition include the following: (1) The certificate was installed from a source that did not include the private key; such as a .cer or .p7b file. (2) The certificate's private key was imported (for example; from a .pfx file) into a user's certificate store instead of the Local Computer Personal store. (3) The certificate was generated as part of a certificate request that did not specify the 'Machine Key' option. (4) The Federation Service identity has not been granted read access to the certificate's private key. User Action If the certificate was imported from a source with no private key; choose a certificate that does have a private key; or import the certificate again from a source that includes the private key (for example; a .pfx file). If the certificate was imported in a user context; import the certificate again directly into the Local Computer Personal store. If the certificate was generated by a certificate request that did not specify the 'Machine Key' option and the key is marked as exportable; export the certificate with a private key from the user store to a .pfx file and import it again directly into the Local Computer Personal store. If the key is not marked as exportable; request a new certificate using the 'Machine Key' option. If the FS Identity has not been granted read access to the certificate's private key; open the AD FS snap-in. In the console tree; right-click Federation Service; and then click Properties. Under Token Signing Certificate; click View.  If the private key has incorrect access control configured; an option to reconfigure the key's access control will appear.,{configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {certificateThumbprint} | {configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {certificateThumbprint}
602,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,During processing of web.config section '{configurationSection}'; the parameter '{configurationParameter}' was found to have invalid data. The certificate that was identified by the thumbprint '{certificateThumbprint}' could not be found. Section: {configurationSection} Parameter: {configurationParameter} Thumbprint: {certificateThumbprint} The Federation Service or the Federation Service Proxy will not be able to start until this configuration parameter is corrected. This condition occurs when the thumbprint that is specified does not match the thumbprint of any certificate in the Local Computer Personal store. Common causes for this condition include the following: (1) The web.config was edited by hand and the thumbprint string contains a typographical error. (2) The certificate with the specified thumbprint is from a user store instead of the Local Computer store. User Action If the web.config contains a typographical error; correct the thumbprint string. To correct the thumbprint string; open the Certificates snap-in. On the Details tab in the certificate property page; select the Thumbprint field. The thumbprint in the web.config should match the string - with the spaces removed - that appears in the property page. If a certificate with a matching thumbprint exists in a user store and a .pfx file for the certificate is available; import the .pfx file directly into the Local Computer Personal store. If no .pfx file is available and the key is exportable; you can create a .pfx file by exporting the certificate with private key. If the key is not exportable and no .pfx file is available; request a new certificate and ensure that the request is for a machine certificate instead of a user certificate.,{configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {certificateThumbprint} | {configurationSection} | {configurationParameter} | {certificateThumbprint}

Ensure that the Federation Service Proxy service account; which is set to Network Service by default; can access the private key of the certificate that was identified by the thumbprint '{proxyCertificateThumbprint}'.  Conditions that can prevent the Federation Service Proxy service account from having access to the certificate private key include the following:(1) The certificate was installed from a file that did not include the private key; such as a .cer or .p7b file. (2) The certificate's private key was imported (for example; from a .pfx file) into a user's certificate store instead of the Local Computer Personal certificate store. (3) The certificate was generated as part of a certificate request that did not specify the 'Machine Key' option. (4) The Federation Service Proxy service account has not been granted Read access to the certificate's private key.Ensure that the Federation Service Internet Information Services (IIS) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server certificate chains to a root that is trusted by the Federation Service Proxy.

When cookies that hold the state for passive client requests cannot be found; requests that are made by the passive client will be received by the Federation Service (or Federation Service Proxy); but they will not be processed. User Action Reconfigure the cookie path. The current cookie path is set to '{configuredCookiePath}'; and the request-Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is set to '{requestUri}'. Unless other client-side configuration or user action causes the cookie to be rejected; client browsers should send the cookie if the cookie path matches the prefix for the request-URI.Cookie path: {configuredCookiePath} Request-URI: {requestUri} Modify the Domain Name System (DNS) name for this site so that it is Request for Comments (RFC)-compliant. Compliant DNS host names contain only letters (A through Z); numerals (0 through 9); minus sign (-); and period (.) characters. Reconfigure the client browser to not reject cookies from this site. Undo any action that might have been taken by a user to reject or delete the cookies that are needed by this transaction. Additional Data For more information about the cookie and request-URI paths; review the following RFCs: RFC 2616 - This RFC describes the appropriate way to compare Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) URIs; and it mandates case-sensitive comparisons for the request-URI path. RFC 2109 - This RFC describes how the cookie path must match a prefix of the request-URI. It is important to note that some browsers treat '/path' or '/path1/samp' as a prefix match of '/path1/sample' while others do not allow matches that consume only parts of the individual words. These strict implementations accept only a subset of those matches that are allowed by the first implementation; for example; '/path1' or '/path1/sample'.,{configuredCookiePath} | {requestUri} | {configuredCookiePath} | {requestUri}
