2001,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server is now booting from the registry or directory. The existing server boot file will no longer be read by the DNS server at startup. For any new zones that you add or for changes you make to zone information; you must make them using the DNS console. The previous DNS server boot file has been moved to the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns\backup directory. To return to using a boot file; use the DNS console and reconfigure the boot method for the server.  For more information; see 'To change the boot method used by the DNS server' in the online Help.,

2147484059,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server has bound one or more socket pool sockets to port numbers from port exclusion range {param1}.,{param1}
2147484062,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server computer currently does not have a DNS domain name.  Its DNS name is a single-label host name with no domain (for example:  'host' rather than 'host.microsoft.com').  You might have forgotten to configure a primary DNS domain for the server computer.  Because the DNS server has only a single-label name; all zones created will have default records (SOA and NS) created using only this single-label name for the server's host name.  This can lead to incorrect and failed referrals when clients and other DNS servers use these records to locate this server by name.  To correct this problem:   1) Click Start; and then click Control Panel.  2) Open System and Maintenance ; and then open System.   3) Click Change Settings; and then click Change.  4) Click either Domain or Workgroup; and then type the name of the domain or  workgroup you want the computer to join; the domain or workgroup name will be used as your DNS domain name.   5) When prompted; restart the computer. After the computer restarts; the DNS server will attempt to fix up default records; substituting the new DNS name of this server for the old single-label name.  However; you should review the zone's SOA and NS records to ensure that they now use the correct domain name of this server.,
2147484354,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server does not have a cache or other database entry for root name servers. Either the root hints file; cache.dns; or Active Directory must have at least one name server (NS) resource record; indicating a root DNS server and a corresponding host (A) resource record for that root DNS server.  Otherwise; the DNS server will be unable to contact the root DNS server on startup and will be unable to answer queries for names outside of its own authoritative zones.  To correct this problem; use the DNS console to update the server root hints.  For more information; see the online Help.,
2147484850,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server encountered an unsupported 'directory' directive in the server boot file {param1} at line {param2}.

2147486278,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server could not configure the network connections of this computer with the local computer's IP address as the preferred DNS server; because this computer is connected to networks with different or invalid DNS namespaces. Manual configuration of the local DNS server to perform name resolution on one or more of the namespaces is required before the preferred DNS servers of this computer should be modified.  If the network connections of this computer are not configured with the local computer's IP address as the preferred DNS server; this computer may not be able to dynamically register DC locator records in DNS. Absence of these records may prevent other Active Directory domain controllers and domain members from locating this domain controller.  User Action:  Ensure that DC locator DNS records enumerated in the file %SystemRoot%\system32\config\netlogon.dns are registered on the local DNS server. If these records are not registered in DNS: a) Add a delegation to this DNS server to parent DNS zone matching the name of the Active Directory domain OR b) Configure the local DNS server with appropriate root hints and forwarders (if necessary) and configure the network connections of this computer with the local computer's IP address as the preferred DNS server. Note that other computers using other DNS servers as their preferred or alternate DNS servers may not be able to locate this domain controller; unless the DNS infrastructure is properly configured.,
2147487661,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server is waiting for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to signal that the initial synchronization of the directory has been completed. The DNS server service cannot start until the initial synchronization is complete because critical DNS data might not yet be replicated onto this domain controller. If events in the AD DS event log indicate that there is a problem with DNS name resolution; consider adding the IP address of another DNS server for this domain to the DNS server list in the Internet Protocol properties of this computer. This event will be logged every two minutes until AD DS has signaled that the initial synchronization has successfully completed.,

The DNS Server will ignore this new copy of the zone. Please resolve this conflict as soon as possible.  If an administrator has moved this zone from one directory partition to another this may be a harmless transient condition. In this case; no action is necessary. The deletion of the original copy of the zone should soon replicate to this server.

DNS servers supplying zones for transfer must have the most recent version of the zone; based on the primary zone.  If zone on remote server {param4}; is in fact the most recent version of the zone; do the following at that server:  (1) stop the DNS server;  (2) delete the zone file (not the zone itself) and  (3) restart the DNS server The DNS server will transfer the new version and write its zone file. When deleting the zone file at server {param4}; locate the file named {param1}.dns in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Dns directory and delete it. An alternative solution is to delete and recreate the secondary zone at server {param4}.  This could be preferred if this server hosts large zones and restarting it at this time would be a consuming or costly operation.,{param1} | {param2} | {param3} | {param4} | {param4} | {param4} | {param1} | {param4}

2147490710,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,The DNS server encountered a packet addressed to itself on IP address {param1}. The packet is for the DNS name '{param2}'. The packet will be discarded. This condition usually indicates a configuration error.  Check the following areas for possible self-send configuration errors:   1) Forwarders list. (DNS servers should not forward to themselves).   2) Master lists of secondary zones.   3) Notify lists of primary zones.   4) Delegations of subzones.  Must not contain NS record for this DNS server unless subzone is also on this server.   5) Root hints.  Example of self-delegation:   -> This DNS server dns1.example.microsoft.com is the primary for the zone example.microsoft.com.   -> The example.microsoft.com zone contains a delegation of bar.example.microsoft.com to dns1.example.microsoft.com;   (bar.example.microsoft.com NS dns1.example.microsoft.com)   -> BUT the bar.example.microsoft.com zone is NOT on this server.  Note; you should make this delegation check (with nslookup or DNS manager) both on this DNS server and on the server(s) you delegated the subzone to. It is possible that the delegation was done correctly; but that the primary DNS for the subzone; has any incorrect NS record pointing back at this server. If this incorrect NS record is cached at this server; then the self-send could result.  If found; the subzone DNS server admin should remove the offending NS record.  You can use the DNS server debug logging facility to track down the cause of this problem.,{param1} | {param2}
