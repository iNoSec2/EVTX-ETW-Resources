In this mode; some sites are still Windows NT 4.0 sites and are mastered by the PEC and PSCs. Mixed mode might require creating/deleting/updating objects that belong to Windows NT 4.0 sites. These operations are not supported by Message Queuing Down-level Client Support.

In this case; the queue affected is {param1}; but note that an event might not be issued every time this problem occurs. To perform this access check; Message Queuing needs access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute of the sender's user object. Only users with domain administration permissions can add members to the Windows Authorization Access Group; which is allowed access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute; in one of two ways: 1) For best security practice; add only the computer accounts that need access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute to the Windows Authorization Access Group. The domain administrator will repeat this operation for other Message Queuing computers that require the permission; manually adding the relevant accounts to the Windows Authorization Access Group. 2) As a less secure practice; add the Authenticated Users group to the Windows Authorization Access group. This grants every authenticated user; including the Message Queuing service on any computer; access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute for all users; and requires no further manual administration.,{param1}
