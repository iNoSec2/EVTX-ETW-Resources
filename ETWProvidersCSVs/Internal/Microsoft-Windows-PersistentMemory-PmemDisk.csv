This type of problem can happen when you update your computer's firmware; or when you upgrade from a version of Windows that doesn't look at atomicity settings to one that does.                          To recover the disk; follow these steps:             1. Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\<instance ID>\Device Parameters'. There will only be one instance ID key.             2. Create a registry key named 'ScmBus'. Inside it; create a new DWORD value named 'IgnoreLabels' and set it to 1.             3. Restart your computer.             4. When Windows starts again; your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks; even the ones that aren't affected by this problem; so it's important to back up all your data.             5. Open the registry editor; navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             6. Restart your computer.             7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it; you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks.

This type of problem can happen when you update your computer's firmware; or when you upgrade from a version of Windows that doesn't look at atomicity settings to one that does.                          To recover the disk; follow these steps:             1. Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\<instance ID>\Device Parameters'. There will only be one instance ID key.             2. Create a registry key named 'ScmBus'. Inside it; create a new DWORD value named 'IgnoreLabels' and set it to 1.             3. Restart your computer.             4. When Windows starts again; your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks; even the ones that aren't affected by this problem; so it's important to back up all your data.             5. Open the registry editor; navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             6. Restart your computer.             7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it; you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks.

Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\<instance ID>\Device Parameters'. There will only be one instance ID key.             2. Create a registry key named 'ScmBus'. Inside it; create a new DWORD value named 'IgnoreLabels' and set it to 1.             3. Restart your computer.             4. When Windows starts again; your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks; even the ones that aren't affected by this problem; so it's important to back up all your data.             5. Open the registry editor; navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             6. Restart your computer.             7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it; you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks.

This type of problem can happen when you update your computer's firmware; or when you upgrade from a version of Windows that doesn't look at atomicity settings to one that does.                          To recover the disk; follow these steps:             1. Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\<instance ID>\Device Parameters'. There will only be one instance ID key.             2. Create a registry key named 'ScmBus'. Inside it; create a new DWORD value named 'IgnoreLabels' and set it to 1.             3. Restart your computer.             4. When Windows starts again; your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks; even the ones that aren't affected by this problem; so it's important to back up all your data.             5. Open the registry editor; navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             6. Restart your computer.             7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it; you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks.

This type of problem can happen when you update your computer's firmware; or when you upgrade from a version of Windows that doesn't look at atomicity settings to one that does.                          To recover the disk; follow these steps:             1. Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to 'Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\<instance ID>\Device Parameters'. There will only be one instance ID key.             2. Create a registry key named 'ScmBus'. Inside it; create a new DWORD value named 'IgnoreLabels' and set it to 1.             3. Restart your computer.             4. When Windows starts again; your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks; even the ones that aren't affected by this problem; so it's important to back up all your data.             5. Open the registry editor; navigate to the 'IgnoreLabels' value you created and set it to 0.             6. Restart your computer.             7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it; you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run 'Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice'.             8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks.
