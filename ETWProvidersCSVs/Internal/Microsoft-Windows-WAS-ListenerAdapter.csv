1073748826,0,,,,,,Windows Server 2008R2,SP1,Standard,2011/02/09,7601,Listener Adapter protocol '{ListenerAdapterProtocol}' is waiting to connect to Windows Process Activation Service.  This event will only be logged once.  Cause: This could be caused by either Windows Process Activation Service not being started; the protocol not being configured in <listenerAdapters> section; or another process already connected as Listener Adapter for that protocol.  Fix: Ensure that Windows Process Activation Service is running; the protocol is configured in the <listenerAdapters> section; and that another process has not already connected as the Listener Adapter for that protocol.,{ListenerAdapterProtocol}
